# ScratchVoiceSynthesizer1.0
The 1.0 version of a simple yet realistic Voice Synthesizer for Scratch.

Download all of the .wav files and rename them to A-Z and after you do each letter, and then add a 2 after that. 

Repeat that another time.

After that, do A-Z first and then add a two after every letter of the alphabet. 

For all these voice files, PLEASE use lowercase lettering.

After that, install Index.js. 

You can then either load it in your Scratch project or Scratch mod of choice, or take the turbowarp link in the Scratch forums.

Check the extensions tab for the 1.0 version of Scratch Voice Synthesizer.

Thanks for reading!
